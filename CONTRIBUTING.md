Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to our assignments and other related repositories. Whether you're a project owner, contributor, or consumer, your participation is invaluable to us.

## Introduction

Our `CONTRIBUTING.md` is designed to be a central guide for contributions to our assignments and supporting repositories. There are two main areas where contributions are highly appreciated:

- **Contributing to Assignments**: Enhancements or corrections to assignments should be submitted via pull requests to the corresponding assignment template repository.
- **General Contributions**: For broader contributions like improvements to course content, additional resources, or updates to documentation, please make a pull request directly to this repository.

## Issues

Issues are very valuable to this project.

  - Ideas are a valuable source of contributions others can make
  - Problems show where this project is lacking
  - With a question you show where contributors can improve the user
    experience

Thank you for creating them.

## Guidelines for Contributions

### Contributing Textual Material

- **Grammar and Clarity**: Use tools like Grammarly to ensure your text is grammatically correct and clear.
- **Structure and Format**: Ensure your document is well-structured and formatted consistently with the rest of the course materials.
- **Informative Titles and Headings**: Use descriptive titles and headings for each section to make the content easily navigable.
- **Citing Sources**: If your contribution includes data or information from other sources, please provide appropriate citations.

### Contributing Code

- **Pull Requests**: Submit your code contributions through a pull request to the relevant public repository.
- **Documentation**: Each function or significant piece of code should include:
  - A clear and concise docstring explaining what the function does.
