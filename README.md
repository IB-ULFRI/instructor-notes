# Instructor's Notes: Introduction to Bioinformatics

Welcome to Our Bioinformatics Course

Welcome to the repository of our comprehensive Bioinformatics course. This document provides a guide to our training materials, designed with the intention of facilitating easy sharing, discovery, and efficient use both by trainers and trainees alike.

## Course Overview

In this course, we dive deep into the fascinating world of bioinformatics. We cover everything from basic concepts to advanced techniques, preparing our students for real-world challenges in the field.

The course is comprised of five homework assignments, where each focuses on a specific aspect of bioinformatics.

|              | Assignment Title           | Github Template                        | Time required* |

## Unique Identity and Registration

To prevent "link rot" and ensure long-term availability, each of our training materials has a unique digital object identifier (DOI). This makes them easily citable and traceable. We've registered these materials with renowned educational resource registries, such as ELIXIR’s TeSS and GOBLET, for broader visibility.

## Formats and Accessibility

In selecting the format for our training materials, we prioritized interoperability and ease of use. For instance, our slides are available in both PowerPoint and PDF formats. We also provide Markdown versions of our documents for those who prefer them.

## Usability for Trainees

Our course is designed with clear learning outcomes in mind. For example, after completing the module on genomic sequencing, students will be able to apply sequencing techniques in a lab setting. The prerequisites are straightforward, ensuring that our target audience, which includes both beginners and intermediate learners, knows what skills and knowledge are needed beforehand.
