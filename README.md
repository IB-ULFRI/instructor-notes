# Instructor's Notes: Introduction to Bioinformatics

Welcome to the repository of University of Bioinformatics course desgined at University of Ljubljana. This document provides a guide to our practical training material, designed with the intention of facilitating easy sharing, discovery, and efficient use both by trainers and trainees alike.

## Course Overview

In this course we take a deep dive into the fascinating world of bioinformatics. We cover everything from basic concepts to advanced techniques, preparing our students for real-world challenges in the field. While we focus here on the assignments, the full course is available to all registered students on their [Moodle home page](https://ucilnica.fri.uni-lj.si/bioinf). To provide context for the assignments, we here provide a list of lectures and place the assignments after the corresponding lectures. While the assignments relate to a group of lectures, the assignments will be posted around the middle of each lecture group.

The course is comprised of five homework assignments, where each focuses on a specific aspect of bioinformatics. Clicking on the assignment link oopens a github template repository.

**The reported time required is obtained from the self-reported time required for ~80% of the students to complete the homework assignment.* 

Github classrom allows us to create private repositories for students based on assignemnt templates.

## Metadata and Discoverability

Our materials are enriched with detailed metadata following standards like BioSchemas, ensuring they are easily discoverable and accessible. Each set of materials comes with clear descriptions, relevant keywords, and structured metadata for enhanced searchability.

| Type of Metadata              | What to Include                                                                                                                                                                                        |
